# scout installation

*This guide is for installing Platypus Scout system on a Raspberry Pi. If you just want to install `platypus-scout-calc`, see the main README in the root folder of this repo*

Clone the repo and navigate to the scout directory:

        cd ~/src/abyss
        git clone git@github.com:abyss-solutions/platypus.git
        cd platypus/scout
	
If installing on Raspbian lite, git and python3-pip will need to be installed first. (n.b vim is also not installed by default)



	./rpi_install.sh


**Note:** if you have already installed the utilities and need to re-install (new changes pulled, local modifications, etc.), `sudo pip3 install .` won't reinstall non-python scripts. Instead, run:

	sudo pip3 install . --upgrade
