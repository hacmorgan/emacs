* A tutorial introduction
** Data types
C has a number of data types: 
- =char=: one byte 
- =int=: integer (size machine dependent, 4 bytes on 64-bit arch)
- =short=: short integer (size machine dependent. 2 bytes on 64-bit arch)
- =long=: long integer (size machine dependent. 8 bytes on 64-bit arch)
- =float=: floating point (size machine dependent. 4 bytes on 64-bit arch)
- =double=: double precision floating point (size machine dependent. 8 bytes on 64-bit arch)

*** [[./chapter-1/farenToCelc.c][Farenheit to celsius]]
In the farenheit to celsius converter, we write
#+BEGIN_SRC C
celsius = 5 * (fahr-32)/9 
#+END_SRC
because integer division truncates any fractional part, so if we wrote
#+BEGIN_SRC C
celsius = 5/9 * (fahr-32)
#+END_SRC
the =5/9= would be truncated to 0.

**** Making the output prettier
Originally we had:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
#+END_SRC
But the output numbers weren't nicely justified. If we include a number in each =%d=, then the output will be right justified as many characters as we specify, so we change the above line to:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
printf("%3d %6d\n", fahr, celsius);
#+END_SRC
